Before file utility can be used, compile 31316115_fileutil.c with gcc into fileutil. 
    gcc -o fileutil 31316115_fileutil.c

fileutil provides functionality to do basic commands in terminal including head, tail, and copy with optional number of lines. To use the utility, 
user must type ./fileutility followed by optional source file, flags, and required arguments if needed. User can type the flag at most one each 
and the flags can be typed in different orders and combinations as long as the required arguments followed the correct flag.

By default, the file used for the utility is "sample.txt" in the current directory viewing 10 first lines in the file (head).
e.g.    ./fileutil  
        displays the first 10 lines of "sample.txt" file in terminal

If user provides source file, it must be stated with absolute path right after ./fileutil.
e.g.    ./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt
        displays the first 10 lines of "a.txt" file in terminal

User can type "-d destination" to create a copy of file to the destination given, note that -d must be followed by an absolute existing destination
path containing no file with the same name.
e.g.    ./fileutil -d /home/student/dir2/
        copy "sample.txt" to dir2 where the newly created "sample.txt" contains the first 10 lines
        ./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -d /home/student/dir2/
        copy "a.txt" to dir2 where the newly created "a.txt" contains the first 10 lines

User can type "-n num" to specify number of lines to be used on the functionality, note that -n must be followed by a number. Functionality will 
use either the default or given number of lines or all of lines if file contains less line than specified.
e.g.    ./fileutil -n 20 /home/student/dir2/
        displays the first 20 lines of "sample.txt" file in terminal
        ./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -n 5
        displays the first 5 lines of "a.txt" file in terminal

User can type "-L" to specify functionality to take the required last number of lines (tail) instead of the required first number of lines (head is set
by default).
e.g.    ./fileutil -L /home/student/dir2/
        displays the last 10 lines of "sample.txt" file in terminal
        ./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -L
        displays the last 10 lines of "a.txt" file in terminal

Some example of commands with different orders and combinations of flag.
e.g.    ./fileutil -L /home/student/dir2/ -n 15
        displays the last 15 lines of "sample.txt" file in terminal
        ./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -n 5 -d /home/student/dir2/ -L
        copy "a.txt" to dir2 where the newly created "a.txt" contains the last 5 lines
